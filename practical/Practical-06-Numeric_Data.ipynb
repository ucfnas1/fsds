    "## 1. The Importance of EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "After a few weeks getting to grips with Python, we’re now going to start\n",
    "working with some real data. One of the first things that we do when\n",
    "working with any new data set is to familiarise ourselves with it. There\n",
    "are a *huge* number of ways to do this, but there are no shortcuts to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Reading about the data (how it was collected, what the sample size\n",
    "    was, etc.)\n",
    "2.  Reviewing any accompanying metadata (data about the data, column\n",
    "    specs, etc.)\n",
    "3.  Looking at the data itself at the row- and column-levels\n",
    "4.  Producing descriptive statistics\n",
    "5.  Visualising the data using plots\n",
    "\n",
    "You should use *all* of these together to really understand where the\n",
    "data came from, how it was handled, and whether there are gaps or other\n",
    "problems. If you’re wondering which comes first, the concept of *start\n",
    "with a chart* is always good… though we’ve obviously not *quite* gotten\n",
    "there yet! This week we want you to get a handle on pandas itself, so\n",
    "although we will do some plotting of charts, we’ll focus on 3-4 with a\n",
    "tiny bit of 5. There will be much more on plotting charts next week, and\n",
    "you should be looking into 1 and 2 yourself based on what’s been written\n",
    "both on the [Inside Airbnb web site](http://insideairbnb.com/about.html)\n",
    "and in the [suggested\n",
    "readings](https://github.com/jreades/i2p/blob/master/ref/Bibliography.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "So although they don’t need to be done now, you probably want to add\n",

    "## 2. Pandas, Conceptually\n",
    "\n",
    "> **🔗 Connections**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This is why we spent time talking about\n",
    "> [Packages](https://jreades.github.io/fsds/sessions/week3.html#pre-recorded-lectures),\n",
    "> [Methods](https://jreades.github.io/fsds/sessions/week4.html#pre-recorded-lectures)\n",

    "> because now we’re going to be making *intensive* use of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas can do a *lot*, and you might be feeling a little intimidated by\n",
    "this, but here’s the thing: we were already writing something like\n",
    "pandas from scratch! That’s because pandas takes a **column-view of\n",
    "data** in the same way that our **Dictionary-of-Lists** did, it’s just\n",
    "that it’s got a lot more features than our ‘simple’ tool did. That’s why\n",
    "the documentation is so much more forbidding and why pandas is so much\n",
    "more powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "But at its heart, a pandas `Data Frame` (`df` for short) is a collection\n",
    "of `Data Series` objects (i.e. columns) with an index. Each Series is\n",
    "like one of our column-lists from the last notebook. And the `df` is\n",
    "like the dictionary that held the data together. So you’ve seen this\n",
    "before and you already *know* what’s going on… or at least you now have\n",
    "an *analogy* that you can use to make sense of pandas:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` default\n",
    "myDataFrame = {\n",
    "    '<column_name_1>': <Series_1>,\n",
    "    '<column_name_2>': <Series_2>,\n",
    "    '<column_name_3>': <Series_3>\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And pandas gives us two ways to access that data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Using a method syntax: `myDataFrame.column_name_1`\n",
    "2.  Using a dictionary syntax: `myDataFrame['column_name_1']`[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on which syntax you prefer, you can use these interchangeably.\n",
    "The only times you *have* to choose one over the other are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Assignment (e.g. `myDataFrame['column_name_1'] = ...`);\n",
    "-   Columns with spaces in their names\n",
    "    (e.g. `myDataFrame['Column Name 1')`).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are [numerous](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=introduction+to+pandas+python)\n",
    "useful introductions; [one of our\n",

    "\n",
    "When starting out it’s common to think in terms of there being one input\n",

    "you typically will have many intermediate outputs used as ‘milestones’\n",
    "in the overall analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   You might have a ‘canonical’ data file that has dealt with\n",
    "    formatting issues and converted the columns to appropriate data\n",
    "    types.\n",
    "-   You might have a ‘clean’ data file that has dealt with observations\n",
    "    that seem to be incomplete or otherwise improperly formatted.\n",
    "-   You might generate subsets by region or area.\n",
    "-   You might produce an ‘analytical’ or ‘final’ data set appropriate to\n",
    "    a specific analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the intermediate outputs is to accelerate each cycle in\n",
    "your development work: if you are re-running the *entire* analytics\n",
    "pipeline *every* time you make a small change at the tail-end of your\n",
    "processing pipeline then you will be drinking a lot of tea because most\n",
    "of your time will be spent watching the computer churn away at the data.\n",
    "It’s also common to receive regular updates of data sets\n",
    "(e.g. InsideAirbnb data is updated rouhgly every six months, while Land\n",
    "Registry’s Price Paid Data for the UK is updated monthly) and you’ll\n",
    "need to know which release you’re working with (i.e. have I already\n",
    "processed the September data???).\n",
    "\n",
    "So we try to get ahead of all this by anticipating that files will be\n",
    "‘versioned’. I do not mean that you’ll put files in Git, but that you’ll\n",
    "need a way to track ‘provenance’ and ‘stage of analysis’ in where and\n",
    "how you save your data. But we also don’t want to mindlessly delete the\n",
    "original, ‘raw’ data: I always prefer to keep the original data set\n",
    "handy since I almost always discover that there are fields I didn’t\n",
    "realise I needed when I started my work.\n",
    "\n",
    "So my approach to coding is usually:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Download the raw file and save it locally in a `data/raw` directory.\n",
    "2.  Load the first `nrows` of data so that I can quickly:\n",
    "    -   Check that the specification matches the data and select\n",
    "        columns/rows accordingly.\n",
    "    -   Identify obviously invalid rows/columns and investigate further.\n",
    "    -   Check the code to fix data types and (where relevant) values\n",
    "        works.\n",
    "    -   Write this new, smaller file ($m` << m$ and $n` << n$) out to a\n",
    "        `data/clean` or `data/canonical` directory (depending on whether\n",
    "        formatting the columns is so complex or takes so long on a large\n",
    "        data set that dealing with data types needs to be separated out\n",
    "        from actual cleaning).\n",
    "    -   Test out some initial ideas for further analysis.\n",
    "3.  Re-run the code (remove the `nrows` limit) using the full data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you might end up with something a bit like this (or this could be\n",
