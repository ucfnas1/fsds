    "## Practical 2: Foundations (Part 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting to grips with the ‘Basics’\n",
    "\n",
    "This week is focussed on ensuring that you’re able to run Jupyter\n",
    "notebooks locally (i.e. on your own computer) and are comfortable with\n",
    "the basics of Python: if you’ve already done Code Camp then this will be\n",
    "a refresher and you’ll have plenty of time to get to grips with Git and\n",
    "GitHub, which often presents significant practical challenges. You\n",
    "*should* find this notebook quite straightforward, but take any\n",
    "challenges as a sign that you need to keep practicing since subsequent\n",
    "weeks will build on these foundational concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.1 Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "-   You have familiarised yourself with how to add and synchronise new\n",
    "    files in Git/GitHub.\n",
    "-   You have refamiliarised yourself with Python operators and\n",
    "    precedence.\n",
    "-   You have refamiliarised yourself with Python logic and lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the foundations for subsequent weeks, so if you are still\n",
    "confused at the end of the practical please look at [Code\n",
    "Camp](https://jreades.github.io/code-camp/) and re-run this practical\n",
    "from scratch if need be!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Starting the Practical\n",
    "\n",
    "The process for every week will be the same: download the notebook to\n",
    "your `fsds` folder; `add`, `commit`, and `push` the notebook in Git;\n",
    "switch over to `JupyterLab` (which will be running in Podman) and get to\n",
    "work. When you’re done for the day, save your changes to the file, then\n",
    "`add`, `commit`, and `push` your work to save the completed notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your GIS class you will be using the Git Desktop, and if that works\n",
    "for you then I won’t insist you use the Terminal; however, I will note\n",
    "that Git only started to make sense (and problems only began to become\n",
    "easier to resolve) once I switched to the Terminal from Git Desktop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Download the Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "So for this week, visit the [Week 2 of FSDS\n",
    "page](https://jreades.github.io/fsds/sessions/week2.html#practical)\n",
    "you’ll see that there is a ‘preview’ link and a a ‘download’ link in the\n",
    "[Practical\n",
    "section](https://jreades.github.io/fsds/sessions/week2.html#practical).\n",
    "If you click the `preview` link you will be taken to the GitHub page for\n",
    "the notebook where it has been ‘rendered’ as a web page. But to make the\n",
    "notebook useable on *your* computer, you need to `download` the IPYNB\n",
    "file.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Click on the `Download` link.\n",
    "2.  The file should download automatically, but *if* you see a page of\n",
    "    raw code, select `File` then `Save Page As...`.\n",
    "3.  Make sure you know where to find the file (e.g. Downloads or\n",
    "    Desktop).\n",
    "4.  Move the file to your Git repository folder\n",
    "    (e.g. `~/Documents/CASA/fsds/`)\n",
    "5.  Check to see if your browser has added `.txt` to the file name:\n",
    "    -   If no, then you can move to adding the file.\n",
    "    -   If yes, then you can either fix the name in the Finder/Windows\n",
    "        Explore, or you can do this in the Terminal using\n",
    "        `mv <name_of_practical>.ipynb.txt <name_of_practical>.ipynb`\n",
    "        (you can even do this in JupyterLab’s terminal if it’s already\n",
    "        running).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Add the Notebook to Git\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Now you can add it to Git and synchronise it with GitHub:\n",
    "    1.  `git add <name_of_practical>.ipynb`\n",
    "    2.  `git commit -m \"Adding Practical 2\"`\n",
    "    3.  `git push`\n",
    "\n",
    "The file should now be in your GitHub repository in its ‘original’\n",
    "format (before you write or run any code).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Switch to JupyterLab\n",
    "\n",
    "I am assuming that you are already running JupyterLab via Podman using\n",
    "the command that we saw in Week 1 and on the [CASA Computing\n",
    "Platform](https://ucl-casa.github.io/sds/). However, if you called\n",
    "`podman run ...` from the ‘wrong place’ then you might not be able to\n",
    "see the recently added practical in your work folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "It that’s the case, then you will need to stop the container so please\n",
    "see the [section below](#is-the-container-running-sec-containers). You\n",
    "need to remember that the startup command is something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` shell\n",
    "podman run ... -v \"$(pwd):/home/jovyan/work\" ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `-v` (short for *volume*) tells Podman what part of *your* computer\n",
    "should be connected to place in container where we store the work\n",
    "(`/home/jovyan/work`). `pwd` is short for ‘print working directory’ and\n",
    "is the location where you ran the startup command! So we’re talking\n",
    "about the location on *your* computer when you access the `work` folder\n",
    "from Jupyter Lab:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   On a Mac, if you just opened a new Terminal and run the Podman\n",
    "    startup command then it will be your `$HOME` (also known as `~`)\n",
    "    directory (e.g. `/Users/<your username>/`) because that’s where new\n",
    "    Terminal windows start by default.\n",
    "-   On a Windows machine it *may* be your `$HOME` directory but we can’t\n",
    "    promise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps a video will help clarify?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Docker and Podman are basically the same!\n",
    "\n",
    "<https://www.youtube.com/embed/5IkwUrYTY78>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Is the Container Running?\n",
    "\n",
    "Podman will happily keep a container running in the background even if\n",
    "you close every open window. So how do you know if the `sds2025`\n",
    "container is already running? There are two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Open the Podman Desktop from the menu and make sure that you select\n",
    "    the `Containers` tab. You *should* see something like this if the\n",
    "    container is *running* and *available*:\n",
    "\n",

    "<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">Container running</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  From the Terminal you should be able to run: `podman ps`. This will\n",
    "    give you output something like this:\n",

    "If the `sds2025` *container* is not running then you’ll need to run the\n",
    "startup command (`docker run...`) covered in the [last practical\n",
    "session](Practical-01-Getting_Started.qmd). If it *is* running but in\n",
    "the wrong place, then you should stop it, use `cd` to navigate to the\n",
    "correct location, and then restart it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.4.1 Connect to Jupyter Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you know the container is running you can connected to Jupyter Lab\n",
    "on [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/work/) and should see\n",
